                        <p>The blue shark is an open-ocean shark (pelagic) species that visits the UK seas in the summer. 
                        They are active predators and feed mainly on small fish and squid, although they are also known to
                        eat sea birds and other small sharks. They have been recorded reaching depths of up to 350m to feed.
                        The largest blue shark caught measured to be over 9ft (2.74m).

                        <p>The greenland shark is a member of the sleeper shark family. The species is primarily found in cold waters
                            such as the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic, their range also extends to the North Sea. The species can 
                            reach a length of 23ft (7m) when fully grown but most are between 6.5ft and 13ft. The life span of this creature
                            can be as long as 500 years.

                        <p>Horn sharks are not the most graceful of swimmers and tend to stick to the sea floor, they have been seen using their
                            pectoral fins to crawl along rocks. They can be found in kelp forests and their diet consists of crustaceans, sea urchins 
                            and small fishes. Females lay spiral egg cases as seen in the image.

                        <p>The megamouth shark is a filter feeder, it is the smallest species of filter feeders. They live near the surface to as deep as 
                            15,000 feet (4600m). Although it is one of the largest sharks in the world, this species was only discovered in 1976. The first
                            known megamouth shark was accidentally captured when it became entangled in a sea anchor.
